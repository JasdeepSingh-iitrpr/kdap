The proposed location for IIT Punjab is Birla seed Farms, Ropar ([[Rupnagar]]), district headquarter of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] near to [[Chandigarh]]. The classes for academic session 2008-2009 were held at [[IIT Delhi]]. The Institute is  now functional at its transit campus in Rupnagar. Foundation stone of IIT Punjab was laid down on 24th feb, 2009 by former Union HRD Minister [[Arjun Singh|Mr. Arjun Singh]].\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFrom the second year onwards, IIT Punjab students have been shifted to its temporary campus (a former women's polytechnic) provided by the government of Punjab. Classes are being held in its temporary campus i.e, former women's polytechnic Rupnagar till its own main campus gets ready. Renovation of temporary campus is going on steadily and IIT Delhi administration is making the campus ready for second year students and coming freshers before the beginning of academic session 2009-2010. Second academic session of IIT Punjab started from 20th of august, 2009. Curriculum for rest of the semesters has been announced to students on the day of their registration.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe government of Punjab has already approved land for permanent campus of about 525 acres in Rupnagar.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Location==\n\t\t\t\t\tIIT Ropar is located at Rupnagar (formerly known as [[Ropar]]) town of the [[Rupnagar district|district Rupnagar]]. Rupnagar was founded in the 11th century and named after Rup Sen son of Raja Rokeshar. Recent excavations and explorations conducted at Rupnagar indicate that the first settlements here were the [[Harappan]]s, who reached the upper [[Satluj]] towards the close of third millennium B.C. The district has rich historical and religious significance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRupnagar town, the district headquarters is 42&nbsp;km. from [[Chandigarh]], the state capital. Rupnagar is well connected by road on [[Indian National Highways|National Highway]] [[NH-21]]. The [[Delhi]]-[[Ambala]]-[[Una, Himachal Pradesh|Una]] railway line passes through Rupnagar and provides good [[Rail transport|rail]] connectivity. The nearest [[airport]] is at Chandigarh at a distance of about 60&nbsp;km. The [[Satluj]] river passes close to Rupnagar.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe climate is characterized by its general dryness, except during the south-west monsoon season, a hot summer and a cold winter. The winter is from mid-November to February, summer from March to June and the monsoon from late June to mid-September. The average annual rainfall in the district is about 776&nbsp;mm with about 78% in the period of June to September.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe current temporary location is a brief 1.5&nbsp;km walk from Rupnagar railway station and the permanent campus is about 4\u20135&nbsp;km from it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Academic system==\n\t\t\t\t\tThe curriculum followed at IIT Ropar provides for a science-based engineering education, with a view to produce quality engineer-scientists. If facilitates broad-based knowledge acquisition and, simultaneously, nurtures a temper for life-long learning and exploration. Students are encouraged to go beyond the classroom to conduct and carry out independent work by means of research projects, guided reading, and by allowing them to join the research activities undertaken by faculty members. The idea behind such a fashioning of the curriculum is the belief that classroom activities must be supplemented by independent study and also by individual research that broadens one's horizon and provides for opportunities to bring one's ideas to fruition.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe academic programme at the institute follows a semester-based credit system. The prominent feature of the credit system is the process of continuous evaluation of a student's performance and the flexibility to allow a student to progress at an an optimum pace suited to his/her ability or convenience, subject to fulfilling minimum requirements for continuation. A minimum Grade Point Average (GPA) is necessary for satisfactory progress and continuation in the programme. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Academic programmes==\n\t\t\t\t\tIn its first year, i.e. academic year 2008-2009, three undergraduate programmes were offered. Admission to these programmes is through the JEE and students are admitted after completing 10+2 schooling.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t*Bachelor of Technology in [[Computer Science and Engineering]]\n\t\t\t\t\t*Bachelor of Technology in [[Electrical Engineering]]\n\t\t\t\t\t*Bachelor of Technology in [[Mechanical Engineering]]\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA recent JEE rankings survey of new and existing IITs placed IIT Ropar on the top among new IITs <ref>http://www.inspirenignite.com/iit-ranking-2010/</ref>.

IIT Ropar also offered admissions for Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Mathematics]] and [[Philosophy]] from 2009 session <ref>http://www.iitd.ac.in/iitrpr/Admission.htm</ref>.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Academic information==\n\t\t\t\t\tThe institute campus developed almost fully by the winter semester of academic session 2009-2010. The first half of academic year 2009-2010 was overseen by faculty from IIT Delhi.  IIT Ropar has also been in talks with three of  UK's best universities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUK institutes,with being quite impressed by the state of art facilities, have extended their support by signing MOU's in various direction.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe director of the institute, along with HRD minister Mr. Kapil Sibbal formally visited them in UK to share experiences, with their response reciprocated by a senior official from UK visiting the campus in the month of February.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStudents from IInd year have been a great opportunity to explore themselves under the able guidance of collaborated UK universities in the months of May-June.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Collaborations in hand and the future plans==\n\t\t\t\t\tIIT Ropar is keen to start collaborative ventures with university(both in India and abroad), industry, and other research institute.

This aspect, we believe, will enable the students to acquaint themselves with latest development in their respective areas of study and pursue their own research interests. This would also result in a constant revision of the contents of courses that are being taught.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe institute encourages its faculty members to initiate research work and provides an initiation grant and also the basic facilities for its sustenance. It also encourages faculty members to establish collaborative research ventures with other research lab and industry. In this regard, the institute is keen to establish Central Research Facility.

This institute is committed to providing state-of-the-art technical education in a variety of fields and also for facilitating transmission of knowledge in keeping with latest developments in pedagogy. These two areas of focus will enable students to gain exposure to recent trends in their chosen domains of study and gain practical experience through a wide variety of activities the institute facilitates in its own campus and arranges for in collaboration with industry and other institutes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==History==\n\t\t\t\t\tThis new institute was established by MHRD in year 2008. The classes for academic session 2008-2009 were held at [[IIT Delhi]]. The Institute started functioning from its transit campus in Rupnagar in August 2009.<ref>http://twocircles.net/2009aug07/iit_punjab_start_working_its_new_campus_aug_20.html</ref><ref>http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-07-21/india/28211741_1_transit-campus-ropar-iit-delhi</ref>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Campus & Location==\n\t\t\t\t\tIIT Ropar is located at Rupnagar (formerly known as [[Ropar]]) town of the [[Rupnagar district|district Rupnagar]]. Rupnagar was founded in the 11th century and named after Rup Sen son of Raja Rokeshar. Recent excavations and explorations conducted at Rupnagar indicate that the first settlements here were the [[Harappan]]s, who reached the upper [[Satluj]] towards the close of third millennium B.C. The district has rich historical and religious significance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRupnagar town, the district headquarters is 42 km. from [[Chandigarh]], the state capital. Rupnagar is well connected by road on [[Indian National Highways|National Highway]] [[NH-21]]. The [[Delhi]]-[[Ambala]]-[[Una, Himachal Pradesh|Una]] railway line passes through Rupnagar and provides good [[Rail transport|rail]] connectivity. The nearest [[airport]] is at Chandigarh at a distance of about 60 km. The [[Satluj]] river passes close to Rupnagar.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe climate is characterized by its general dryness, except during the south-west monsoon season, a hot summer and a cold winter. The winter is from mid-November to February, summer from March to June and the monsoon from late June to mid-September. The average annual rainfall in the district is about 776 mm with about 78% in the period of June to September.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t===Permanent Campus===\n\t\t\t\t\tThe location for permanent campus of IIT Ropar is Birla Seed Farms, Ropar ([[Rupnagar]]), district headquarter of Ropar ([[Rupnagar]]) near to [[Chandigarh]]. The Institute is expected to be operational from its permanent campus by 2013. The Government of Punjab has already approved land for permanent campus of about {{convert|525|acre|km2}} in Rupnagar. Foundation stone for permanent campus of IIT Ropar was laid down on 24 February 2009 by former Union HRD Minister [[Arjun Singh|Mr. Arjun Singh]].\n\n\t\t\t\t\t===Temporary Campus===\n\t\t\t\t\tThe temporary campus of IIT Ropar is former Women's Polytechnic, Rupnagar. The academic and administration buildings have been completely renovated to accommodate all the requirements of the Institute . It has all the basic infrastructure to run Academic programmes specially designed by IIT Delhi. The transit campus is equipped with state of art lecture halls along with well maintained playgrounds to nurture the bright minds and enhance their overall development. Special emphasis has been laid to set up advanced laboratories to help students gain practical insight of the courses that are a part of their curriculum.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe current temporary campus is a brief 1 km walk from Rupnagar railway station and the permanent campus is about 4\u20135 km from it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Academic system==\n\t\t\t\t\tThe curriculum followed at IIT Ropar provides for a science-based engineering education, with a view to produce quality engineer-scientists. If facilitates broad-based knowledge acquisition and, simultaneously, nurtures a temper for life-long learning and exploration. Students are encouraged to go beyond the classroom to conduct and carry out independent work by means of research projects, guided reading, and by allowing them to join the research activities undertaken by faculty members. The idea behind such a fashioning of the curriculum is the belief that classroom activities must be supplemented by independent study and also by individual research that broadens one's horizon and provides for opportunities to bring one's ideas to fruition.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe academic programme at the institute follows a semester-based credit system. The prominent feature of the credit system is the process of continuous evaluation of a student's performance and the flexibility to allow a student to progress at an an optimum pace suited to his/her ability or convenience, subject to fulfilling minimum requirements for continuation. A minimum Grade Point Average (GPA) is necessary for satisfactory progress and continuation in the programme.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Academic programmes==\n\t\t\t\t\tIn its first year, i.e. academic year 2008-2009, three undergraduate programmes were offered. Admission to these programmes is through the JEE and students are admitted after completing 10+2 (high-school level) schooling.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t*Bachelor of Technology in [[Computer Science and Engineering]]\n\t\t\t\t\t*Bachelor of Technology in [[Electrical Engineering]]\n\t\t\t\t\t*Bachelor of Technology in [[Mechanical Engineering]]\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIIT Ropar also offers admissions for Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Mathematics]] and [[Philosophy]].<ref>http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/html/phdadmission.shtml</ref>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Academic information==\n\t\t\t\t\tThe institute's transit campus developed almost fully by the winter semester of academic session 2009-2010. The first half of academic year 2009-2010 was overseen by faculty from IIT Delhi.  IIT Ropar has also been in talks with three of the United Kingdom's best universities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe UK institutes, with being quite impressed by the state of art facilities at IIT Ropar, have extended their support by signing MoU's in various directions.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Director of the institute, Prof. M.K. Surappa, along with HRD minister Mr. Kapil Sibbal formally visited the universities in UK to share experiences, with their response reciprocated by a senior official from UK visiting the campus in the month of February.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStudents of the 2008 batch have had a great opportunity to explore their academic abilities under the able guidance of collaborated UK universities in the months of May\u2013June, 2010.<ref>http://www1.aston.ac.uk/international-students/international-news/news-archive/july-2010/aston-university-welcomes-iit-ropar-students/</ref>\n\t\t\t\t\tThe students of the 2008 batch are currently (for the summer period of 2011, May-July) undergoing Industrial Training & Research at various leading industries, companies and other research institutes (such as Microsoft, Bell Labs, Aston University-UK, CSIO-India, Bharti Airtel, Hero Honda, Maruti Suzuki, etc.) in their respective fields.

According to professor S V Raghavan, chairman, technical advisory committee, NKN, \u201cto begin with 1,200 major institutions including the IITs, CSIR laboratories, space research and atomic energy institutions will be connected digitally. The infrastructure bandwidth will facilitate high speed classroom sessions. You can even transmit satellite television programmes using the facility. With just '4' megabit connectivity an institution can simultaneously conduct up to '250' classroom sessions.\u201d``\t\tThe seamless integration provided by the high capacity NKN digital connectivity will help the academic and research community to establish countrywide classrooms, multicasting, streaming, video and voice conferencing, grid computing, digital libraries and collaboration portals. A professor from the IIT may not have the time to visit a rural college to deliver a guest lecture. Also not every institution may have the financial resources to arrange for guest faculty visits from premier research organisations.``\t\tInterestingly, this revolutionary bandwidth connectivity has been put in place by using the extensive Optical Fibre Cable (OFC) networks of the BSNL, Railtel and Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL). In fact, Raghavan describes the underground OFC network as \u201cthe buried treasure of the nation\u201d which has now come in handy to create \u201can exciting win^win situation\u201d through a co^ownership pattern where the network operators stand to gain by selling additional bandwidth, while it facilitates knowledge sharing for educational institutions. The NKN was a joint initiative of the National Knowledge Commission and the union government. This network has the capacity to connect as many as 30,000 to 40,000 universities and colleges. `\t\t<ref>http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/nkn/</ref>``\t\t===Security===`\t\tThe 310 "}, {"text": "1029 -1 in^`\t\t1) 3 -1 Engineering,`\t\t2) 1 -1 Engineering,`\t\t3) 1 -1 Engineering,`\t\t4) -1 Physics `\t\t5) -1 Chemistry `\t\t6) -1 Mathematics -1 `\t\t7) -1 Philosophy.`\t\t<ref>http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/html/phdadmission.shtml</ref>``\t\t==Academic 1886 "}, {"text": "1029 -1 in^`\t\t* 3 -1 Engineering,`\t\t* 1 -1 Engineering,`\t\t* 1 -1 Engineering,`\t\t* 1 -1 `\t\t* 1 -1 `\t\t* 1 -1 `\t\t* 1887 "}, {"text": "2336 -1 subscription).<ref>http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/html/centrallibrary.shtml</ref>`\t\t===NKN@IIT ROPAR^\"National -3 1 -1 Network\"===`\t\tThe 589 "}, {"text": "2829 was Hero Honda,Joint sponsor was BSNL,Associate sponsor 1 -2 ACC,ICON,Godrej intero,TIME 1 several other sponsors such as GAIL(India)limited,Design Tech,Desein,NTPC,Allahabad bank and many more..`\t\t 96 "}, {"text": "2850 more.the -2 95 "}, {"text": "677 -1 Campus===`\t\t[[File:Iit_ropar_campus.jpg|right|370px|IIT Ropar temporary campus ]]`\t\tThe 42 -1 Delhi.The -1 2224 "}, {"text": "677 -1 Campus===`\t\t[[File:Iit_ropar_campus.jpg|thumb|right|370px|IIT 2271 "}, {"text": "1227 -1 Suzuki,Nokia and Siemens 1721 "}, {"text": "2341 -1 subscription).<ref>http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/html/centrallibrary.shtml</ref>`\t\t===Security===`\t\tThe -282 327 "}, {"text": "677 Campus===`\t\tThe -5 42 -1 Delhi.

The classes for academic session 2008-2009 were held at [[IIT Delhi]]. The Institute started functioning from its transit campus in Rupnagar in August 2009.<ref>http://twocircles.net/2009aug07/iit_punjab_start_working_its_new_campus_aug_20.html</ref><ref>http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-07-21/india/28211741_1_transit-campus-ropar-iit-delhi</ref>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Campus & Location==\n\t\t\t\t\tIIT Ropar is located at Rupnagar (formerly known as [[Ropar]]) town of the [[Rupnagar district|district Rupnagar]]. Rupnagar was founded in the 11th century and named after Rup Sen son of Raja Rokeshar. Recent excavations and explorations conducted at Rupnagar indicate that the first settlements here were the [[Harappan]]s, who reached the upper [[Satluj]] towards the close of third millennium B.C. The district has rich historical and religious significance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRupnagar town, the district headquarters is 42 km. from [[Chandigarh]], the state capital. Rupnagar is well connected by road on [[Indian National Highways|National Highway]] [[NH-21]]. The [[Delhi]]-[[Ambala]]-[[Una, Himachal Pradesh|Una]] railway line passes through Rupnagar and provides good [[Rail transport|rail]] connectivity. The nearest [[airport]] is at Chandigarh at a distance of about 60 km. The [[Satluj]] river passes close to Rupnagar.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe climate is characterized by its general dryness, except during the south-west monsoon season, a hot summer and a cold winter. The winter is from mid-November to February, summer from March to June and the monsoon from late June to mid-September. The average annual rainfall in the district is about 776 mm with about 78% in the period of June to September.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t===Permanent Campus===\n\t\t\t\t\tThe location for permanent campus of IIT Ropar is Birla Seed Farms, Ropar ([[Rupnagar]]), district headquarter of Ropar ([[Rupnagar]]) near to [[Chandigarh]].

Rupnagar was founded in the 11th century and named after Rup Sen son of Raja Rokeshar. Recent excavations and explorations conducted at Rupnagar indicate that the first settlements here were the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappans]], who reached the upper [[Satluj]] towards the close of third millennium B.C. The district has rich historical and religious significance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRupnagar town, the district headquarters is 42 km. from [[Chandigarh]], the state capital. Rupnagar is well connected by road on [[Indian National Highways|National Highway]] [[NH-21]]. The [[Delhi]]-[[Ambala]]-[[Una, Himachal Pradesh|Una]] railway line passes through Rupnagar and provides good [[Rail transport|rail]] connectivity. The nearest [[airport]] is at Chandigarh at a distance of about 60 km. The [[Satluj]] river passes close to Rupnagar.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe climate is characterized by its general dryness, except during the south-west monsoon season, a hot summer and a cold winter. The winter is from mid-November to February, summer from March to June and the monsoon from late June to mid-September. The average annual rainfall in the district is about 776 mm with about 78% in the period of June to September.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t===Permanent campus===\n\t\t\t\t\tThe location for permanent campus of IIT Ropar is Birla Seed Farms, Ropar ([[Rupnagar]]), district headquarter of Ropar ([[Rupnagar]]) near to [[Chandigarh]]. The Institute is expected to be operational from its permanent campus by 2013. The Government of Punjab has already approved land for permanent campus of about {{convert|525|acre|km2}} in Rupnagar. Foundation stone for permanent campus of IIT Ropar was laid down on 24 February 2009 by former Union HRD Minister [[Arjun Singh|Mr. Arjun Singh]].\n\t\t\t\t\t<!-- [[Image:IIT ROPAR.jpg|thumb|right|Temporary campus]] -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t===Temporary campus===\n\t\t\t\t\tThe temporary campus of IIT Ropar is former Women's Polytechnic, Rupnagar. The academic and administration buildings have been completely renovated to accommodate all the requirements of the Institute . It has all the basic infrastructure to run Academic programmes specially designed by IIT Delhi. The transit campus is equipped with state of art lecture halls along with well maintained playgrounds to nurture the bright minds and enhance their overall development. Special emphasis has been laid to set up advanced laboratories to help students gain practical insight of the courses that are a part of their curriculum.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe current temporary campus is a brief 1 km walk from Rupnagar railway station and the permanent campus is about 4\u20135 km from it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Academic system==\n\t\t\t\t\tThe curriculum followed at IIT Ropar provides for a science-based engineering education, with a view to produce quality engineer-scientists. If facilitates broad-based knowledge acquisition and, simultaneously, nurtures a temper for life-long learning and exploration. Students are encouraged to go beyond the classroom to conduct and carry out independent work by means of research projects, guided reading, and by allowing them to join the research activities undertaken by faculty members. The idea behind such a fashioning of the curriculum is the belief that classroom activities must be supplemented by independent study and also by individual research that broadens one's horizon and provides for opportunities to bring one's ideas to fruition.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe academic programme at the institute follows a semester-based credit system. The prominent feature of the credit system is the process of continuous evaluation of a student's performance and the flexibility to allow a student to progress at an an optimum pace suited to his/her ability or convenience, subject to fulfilling minimum requirements for continuation. A minimum Grade Point Average (GPA) is necessary for satisfactory progress and continuation in the programme.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Academic programmes==\n\t\t\t\t\tIn its first year, i.e. academic year 2008-2009, three undergraduate programmes were offered. Admission to these programmes is through the JEE and students are admitted after completing 10+2 (high-school level) schooling.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t*Bachelor of Technology in [[Computer Science and Engineering]]\n\t\t\t\t\t*Bachelor of Technology in [[Electrical Engineering]]\n\t\t\t\t\t*Bachelor of Technology in [[Mechanical Engineering]]\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIIT Ropar also offers admissions for Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Mathematics]] and [[Philosophy]].<ref>http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/html/phdadmission.shtml</ref>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Academic information==\n\t\t\t\t\tThe institute's transit campus developed almost fully by the winter semester of academic session 2009-2010. The first half of academic year 2009-2010 was overseen by faculty from IIT Delhi.  IIT Ropar now has faculty members for seven different departments and schools functional at the institute. <ref>http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/html/faculty.shtml</ref>\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStudents of the IIT Ropar have had a great opportunities to explore their research capabilities under the able guidance of collaborated UK universities for different Summer sessions.<ref>http://www1.aston.ac.uk/international-students/international-news/news-archive/july-2010/aston-university-welcomes-iit-ropar-students/</ref>\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe first (pioneering) batch of students from the B.Tech programme at IIT Ropar graduated in May 2012 and will be receiving the degrees in September 2012 at the convocation held at the institute.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Collaborations in hand and the future plans==\n\t\t\t\t\tIIT Ropar is keen to start collaborative ventures with universities, industries, and other research institutes (both in India and outside India). In sequel to the agreement signed between the Prime Minister of India and its counterpart in UK in June 2008, a number of universities and their consortia have expressed keen interest in collaborating with IIT Ropar. In the last few months, the Director, Prof. Surappa, has signed a number of MOUs with his counterparts in various universities in the United Kingdom. They have also had several visitors from universities abroad with a view to establish partnership in research and teaching.<ref>http://www.indianexpress.com/news/uk-tieup-on-cards-for-iiserpune-iitpunja/559079/</ref><ref>http://www.ukieri.org/Minister-Pat-McFadden-visit-Feb2010.htm</ref>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Research==\n\t\t\t\t\tThe institute, apart from establishing robust teaching environment, is keen to facilitate and support cutting-edge research in a variety of areas. This aspect will enable the students to acquaint themselves with latest development in their respective areas of study and pursue their own research interests. This would also result in a constant revision of the contents of courses that are being taught.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe institute encourages its faculty members to initiate research work and provides an initiation grant and also the basic facilities for its sustenance. It also encourages faculty members to establish collaborative research ventures with other research lab and industry. In this regard, the institute is keen to establish Central Research Facility. The institute has already started its PhD programme, so that the research environment is further augmented, expanded, and made even more vibrant.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Campus life/Infrastructure==\n\t\t\t\t\t===Hostel Facilities===\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Institute campus houses five hostels: four for boys (Mercury Wings A & B, Jupiter and Neptune Houses) and one for girls (Venus House). The hostels are well equipped for comfortable lodging and boarding of approximately 550 students. All hostels are provided with water coolers and RO water filter systems. Each hostel has a common room that provides facilities for indoor recreation and games. The hostel complex also includes four shops that cater to the basic needs of the residents, and also two laundry centers. High speed internet is available via wireless internet (spread in the complete campus area) and LAN connections provided by BSNL India.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe day-to-day management of hostels is taken care of by a committee consisting of student representatives, faculty members (as Wardens) and administrative staff (caretakers, office-heads).\n\t\t\t\t\tInstitute has its own independent post office opened for the staff and students of the institute.

Rupnagar was founded in the 11th century and named after Rup Sen son of Raja Rokeshar. Recent excavations and explorations conducted at Rupnagar indicate that the first settlements here were the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappans]], who reached the upper [[Satluj]] towards the close of third millennium B.C. The district has rich historical and religious significance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRupnagar town, the district headquarters is 42&nbsp;km. from [[Chandigarh]], the state capital. Rupnagar is well connected by road on [[Indian National Highways|National Highway]] [[NH-21]]. The [[Delhi]]-[[Ambala]]-[[Una, Himachal Pradesh|Una]] railway line passes through Rupnagar and provides good rail connectivity. The nearest airport is at Chandigarh at a distance of about 60&nbsp;km. The [[Satluj]] river passes close to Rupnagar.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe climate is characterised by its general dryness, except during the south-west monsoon season, a hot summer and a cold winter. The winter is from mid-November to February, summer from March to June and the monsoon from late June to mid-September. The average annual rainfall in the district is about 776&nbsp;mm with about 78% in the period of June to September.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t===Permanent campus===\n\t\t\t\t\tThe location for permanent campus of IIT Ropar is Birla Seed Farms, Rupnagar, district headquarter of Rupnagar near to Chandigarh.

Rupnagar was founded in the 11th century and named after Rup Sen son of Raja Rokeshar. Recent excavations and explorations conducted at Rupnagar indicate that the first settlements here were the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappans]], who reached the upper [[Satluj]] towards the close of third millennium B.C. The district has rich historical and religious significance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRupnagar town is the headquarters of district Rupnagar and is located 42&nbsp;km. from [[Chandigarh]], the state capital. It is connected by road on [[Indian National Highways|National Highway]] [[NH-21]]. The [[Delhi]]-[[Ambala]]-[[Una, Himachal Pradesh|Una]] railway line passes through Rupnagar and provides rail connectivity. The nearest airport is at Chandigarh at a distance of about 60&nbsp;km. The [[Satluj]] river passes close to Rupnagar.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe climate is characterised by its general dryness, except during the south-west monsoon season, a hot summer and a cold winter. The winter is from mid-November to February, summer from March to June and the monsoon from late June to mid-September. The average annual rainfall in the district is about 776&nbsp;mm with about 78% in the period of June to September.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t===Permanent campus===\n\t\t\t\t\tThe location for permanent campus of IIT Ropar is Birla Seed Farms, Rupnagar.

Rupnagar was founded in the 11th century and named after Rup Sen son of Raja Rokeshar. Recent excavations and explorations conducted at Rupnagar indicate that the first settlements here were the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappans]], who reached the upper [[Satluj]] towards the close of third millennium B.C. The district has rich historical and religious significance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRupnagar town is the headquarters of district Rupnagar and is located 42&nbsp;km. from [[Chandigarh]], the state capital. It is connected by road on [[Indian National Highways|National Highway]] [[NH-21]]. The [[Delhi]]-[[Ambala]]-[[Una, Himachal Pradesh|Una]] railway line passes through Rupnagar and provides rail connectivity. The nearest airport is at Chandigarh at a distance of about 60&nbsp;km. The [[Satluj]] river passes close to Rupnagar.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe climate is characterised by its general dryness, except during the south-west monsoon season, a hot summer and a cold winter. The winter is from mid-November to February, summer from March to June and the monsoon from late June to mid-September. The average annual rainfall in the district is about 776&nbsp;mm with about 78% in the period of June to September.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t===Permanent campus===\n\t\t\t\t\tThe location for permanent campus of IIT Ropar is Birla Seed Farms, Rupnagar. The Government of Punjab has approved about {{convert|525|acre|km2}} land for the permanent campus in Rupnagar. Foundation stone for the permanent campus of IIT Ropar was laid down on 24 February 2009 by former Union HRD Minister [[Arjun Singh|Mr. Arjun Singh]]. The contract is given to CPWD and a Bangkok-based construction company is assigned the task of finishing the first phase. \n\t\t\t\t\t[[File:IIT Ropar - Main Building of the Transit Campus.JPG|thumbnail|IIT Ropar transit campus]]\n\t\t\t\t\t<!-- [[Image:IIT ROPAR.jpg|thumb|right|Temporary campus]] -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t===Temporary campus===\n\t\t\t\t\tThe temporary campus of IIT Ropar is former Women's Polytechnic, Rupnagar. The academic and administration buildings of the Women's Polytechnic were completely renovated to accommodate all the requirements of the Institute . It has all the basic infrastructure to run Academic programmes specially designed by IIT Delhi. The transit campus is equipped with state of art lecture halls along with well \n\t\t\t\t\tmaintained playgrounds to nurture the bright minds and enhance their overall development. Special emphasis has been laid to set up advanced laboratories to help students gain practical insight of the courses that are a part of their curriculum.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe current temporary campus is a brief 1&nbsp;km walk from Rupnagar railway station.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Academic system==\n\t\t\t\t\tThe curriculum followed at IIT Ropar provides for a science-based engineering education, with a view to produce quality engineer-scientists. If facilitates broad-based knowledge acquisition and, simultaneously, nurtures a temper for lifelong learning and exploration. Students are encouraged to go beyond the classroom to conduct and carry out independent work by means of research projects, guided reading, and by allowing them to join the research activities undertaken by faculty members. The idea behind such a fashioning of the curriculum is the belief that classroom activities must be supplemented by independent study and also by individual research that broadens one's horizon and provides for opportunities to bring one's ideas to fruition.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe academic programme at the institute follows a semester-based credit system. The prominent feature of the credit system is the process of continuous evaluation of a student's performance and the flexibility to allow a student to progress at an optimum pace suited to his/her ability or convenience, subject to fulfilling minimum requirements for continuation. A minimum Grade Point Average (GPA) is necessary for satisfactory progress and continuation in the programme.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t===Rankings===\n\t\t\t\t\t{{Infobox India university ranking\n\t\t\t\t\t| type = University and college\n\t\t\t\t\t<!----------International---------->\n\t\t\t\t\t| QS_W = \n\t\t\t\t\t| QS_A = \n\t\t\t\t\t| THES_W = \n\t\t\t\t\t| ARWU_W = \n\t\t\t\t\t<!----------General---------->\n\t\t\t\t\t| CAREER_U = \n\t\t\t\t\t<!----------Engineering---------->\n\t\t\t\t\t| NIRF = 9\n\t\t\t\t\t| IT_E = \n\t\t\t\t\t| OUTLOOK = \n\t\t\t\t\t| DQ = \n\t\t\t\t\t| CSR_E = \n\t\t\t\t\t| MINT_P = \n\t\t\t\t\t| MINT_G = \n\t\t\t\t\t| EFY= \n\t\t\t\t\t<!----------Law---------->\n\t\t\t\t\t| IT_L = \n\t\t\t\t\t| MINT_L = \n\t\t\t\t\t<!----------Business---------->\n\t\t\t\t\t| IT_B = \n\t\t\t\t\t| CSR_B =\n\t\t\t\t\t}}\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIIT Ropar was ranked 9th in National Institutional Ranking Framework published by Ministry of Human Resource Development in April 2016.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Departments==\n\t\t\t\t\tThe institute flagged its beginning with the following 9 departments including 4 engineering departments, and 5 supporting departments all of which offer PhD programme.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t* [http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/cbme Center for Biomedical Engineering (CBME)]\n\t\t\t\t\t* Center for Materials and Energy Engineering\n\t\t\t\t\t* [http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/chemistry Chemistry]\n\t\t\t\t\t* [http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/civil Civil Engineering]\n\t\t\t\t\t* [http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/cse Computer Science & Engineering]\n\t\t\t\t\t* [http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/department-electrical-engineering Electrical Engineering]\n\t\t\t\t\t* [http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/humanities Humanities and Social Sciences]\n\t\t\t\t\t* [http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/mathematics Mathematics]\n\t\t\t\t\t* [http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/smmee Mechanical Engineering]\n\t\t\t\t\t* [http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/physics Physics]\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Academic Programmes==\n\n\t\t\t\t\t===Bachelor's Degree===\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn its first year of inception 2008\u20132009, three undergraduate programmes were offered.

Rupnagar was founded in the 11th century and named after Rup Sen son of Raja Rokeshar. Recent excavations and explorations conducted at Rupnagar indicate that the first settlements here were the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappans]], who reached the upper [[Satluj]] towards the close of third millennium B.C. The district has rich historical and religious significance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRupnagar town is the headquarters of district Rupnagar and is located 42&nbsp;km. from [[Chandigarh]], the state capital. It is connected by road on [[Indian National Highways|National Highway]] [[NH-21]]. The [[Delhi]]-[[Ambala]]-[[Una, Himachal Pradesh|Una]] railway line passes through Rupnagar and provides rail connectivity. The nearest airport is at Chandigarh at a distance of about 60&nbsp;km. The [[Satluj]] river passes close to Rupnagar.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe climate is characterised by its general dryness, except during the south-west monsoon season, a hot summer and a cold winter. The winter is from mid-November to February, summer from March to June and the monsoon from late June to mid-September. The average annual rainfall in the district is about 776&nbsp;mm with about 78% in the period of June to September.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t===Permanent campus===\n\t\t\t\t\tThe location for permanent campus of IIT Ropar is Birla Seed Farms, Rupnagar. The Government of Punjab has approved about {{convert|525|acre|km2}} land for the permanent campus in Rupnagar. Foundation stone for the permanent campus of IIT Ropar was laid down on 24 February 2009 by former Union HRD Minister [[Arjun Singh|Mr. Arjun Singh]]. The contract is given to CPWD and a Bangkok-based construction company is assigned the task of finishing the first phase. \n\t\t\t\t\t[[File:IIT Ropar - Main Building of the Transit Campus.JPG|thumbnail|IIT Ropar transit campus]]\n\t\t\t\t\t<!-- [[File:IIT ROPAR.jpg|thumb|right|Temporary campus]] -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t===Temporary campus===\n\t\t\t\t\tThe temporary campus of IIT Ropar is former Women's Polytechnic, Rupnagar.

If facilitates broad-based knowledge acquisition and, simultaneously, nurtures a temper for lifelong learning and exploration. Students are encouraged to go beyond the classroom to conduct and carry out independent work by means of research projects, guided reading, and by allowing them to join the research activities undertaken by faculty members. The idea behind such a fashioning of the curriculum is the belief that classroom activities must be supplemented by independent study and also by individual research that broadens one's horizon and provides for opportunities to bring one's ideas to fruition.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe academic programme at the institute follows a semester-based credit system. The prominent feature of the credit system is the process of continuous evaluation of a student's performance and the flexibility to allow a student to progress at an optimum pace suited to his/her ability or convenience, subject to fulfilling minimum requirements for continuation. A minimum Grade Point Average (GPA) is necessary for satisfactory progress and continuation in the programme.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t===Rankings===\n\t\t\t\t\t{{Infobox India university ranking\n\t\t\t\t\t| type = University and college\n\t\t\t\t\t<!----------International---------->\n\t\t\t\t\t| QS_W = \n\t\t\t\t\t| QS_A = \n\t\t\t\t\t| THES_W = \n\t\t\t\t\t| ARWU_W = \n\t\t\t\t\t<!----------General---------->\n\t\t\t\t\t| CAREER_U = \n\t\t\t\t\t<!----------Engineering---------->\n\t\t\t\t\t| NIRF = 21\n\t\t\t\t\t| IT_E = \n\t\t\t\t\t| OUTLOOK = \n\t\t\t\t\t| DQ = \n\t\t\t\t\t| CSR_E = \n\t\t\t\t\t| MINT_P = \n\t\t\t\t\t| MINT_G = \n\t\t\t\t\t| EFY= \n\t\t\t\t\t<!----------Law---------->\n\t\t\t\t\t| IT_L = \n\t\t\t\t\t| MINT_L = \n\t\t\t\t\t<!----------Business---------->\n\t\t\t\t\t| IT_B = \n\t\t\t\t\t| CSR_B =\n\t\t\t\t\t}}\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIIT Ropar is ranked 21 in ''[[National Institutional Ranking Framework]]'' published by [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]] in April 2017.<ref name=Rankings_NIRF/>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Departments==\n\t\t\t\t\tThe institute flagged its beginning with the following 10 departments including 4 engineering and 6 science departments, all of which offer PhD programme.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t==Academic Programmes==\n\n\t\t\t\t\t===Bachelor's Degree===\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn its first year of inception 2008\u20132009, three undergraduate programmes were offered.
